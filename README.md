# ForgottenFridgeFood: React Native App

ForgottenFridgeFood is my first project ever, i build this application from **scratch**. I wanted to try new technologies and learn more about mobile development. 

### About app

Primary goal of this application is to reduce food waste, it will track all of your fridge food and send you notification whenever food deadline is. Also, for example if you're in supermarket buying yourself food, you can run this application and see content of your fridge and just like that you will know what food are u missing out and what food is soon going to expire. Aside from all of that you have *Shopping screen* where u can write your shopping list easily, and last screen is *Impact screen* where you can see how much impact will made this application, how many users using it and etc

#### Technologies
